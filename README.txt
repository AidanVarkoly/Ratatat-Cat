!----WARNING: THIS BUILD IS NOT COMPLETE, THERE ARE WORKAROUNDS IN PLACE TO ALLOW THE GAME TO BE PLAYED FROM START TO FINISH----!

How to play:
1) When game loads up it will deal out all the cards. The player's outer two cards will start face up. To begin the game, the player must click on any card.
2) When the player's turn comes around they can either choose to pick a card from the draw pile (right) or the discard pile (left).
2a) For either choice the player can then choose a card from their hand to swap the new "selected" card with.
2b) If the player decided to draw from the drawpile they also have the choice to put their "selected" card in the discard pile.
3) After each player has gone 8 times, for a total of 32 turns, the game will choose a winner by totalling the values of each card and displaying the name of the winner
3a) This is how it should work, but it doesn't. The game will always say the last person to go wins.
3b) The game also doesn't restart properly, so that's nice. To restart it requires a full restart of the game.

Other notes:
- the AI will only swap cards, if they get a powercard it is treated no differently than a numbered card.
